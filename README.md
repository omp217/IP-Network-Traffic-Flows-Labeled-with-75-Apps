## Protocol Classification Problem

## User Classification Problem

### Problem

The goal is to categorize users into distinct groups—Low Consumption, Medium Consumption, and High Consumption—based on their data plan usage. This classification enables the implementation of personalized policies within LTE network architectures, ensuring a more tailored and efficient use of network resources.

### Work

The following steps have been taken to address the user classification problem:

1. **K-Means Clustering:**
   - Users were initially classified into 2, 3, or 4 groups using K-Means Clustering.

2. **Classification Algorithms:**
   - Various classification algorithms were employed to categorize users into 2, 3, or 4 groups.

3. **Tree-Based Algorithms:**
   - Notably, tree-based algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost exhibited superior performance due to the dataset's nature.

4. **Utilized Algorithms:**
   - The following algorithms were used for user classification:
     - K-Nearest Neighbors
     - Support Vector Machine
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost
     - Artificial Neural Network

The comprehensive approach combines data mining and traditional machine learning techniques to derive insights into consumption behavior. The classification model, by grouping users based on their consumption patterns, enables the implementation of personalized policies. This, in turn, facilitates the enhancement of network security, maintenance of service quality, prevention of network failures, and the potential for offering targeted data plans to users.
